A licensed nurse presents to her personal physician for recurring problems of a generalized rash and itching.  She works in an intensive care unit and is constantly handing chemicals, disinfectants, assisting in surgical procedures and performing catheter cares for her patients.  As a part of the health history, she noticed that she had an eruption on her hands after handling latex catheters.  Additionally, she reports a serious allergic reaction to papaya in the past and has been careful in the fruits she eats as a consequence.  The clinician suspects a latex allergy cross-reacting with foodstuffs and orders IgE testing for Hevea latex antibody.  The serology testing is strongly positive and the clinician advises the nurse of his findings with warnings about other foods, which may cross react.
