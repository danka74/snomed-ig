###  Test Suites for using SNOMED CT with FHIR Servers

* Examples of REST calls and their expected results (using SNOMED where possible), with narrative including any associated business logic.   
* Be sure to make FHIR version and SNOMED CT Edition for each test clear
* Pick SNOMED concepts that aren't likely to be retired any time soon.   Some tests will be more vulnerable than others eg checking the number of concepts subsumed.
* Suggested to use and extend the test scripts used in previous Connectathons.
* Potential to save resources from "Postman" as an aide.
* Would be beneficial if SNOMED International server could use test script resources in a generic way as part of unit / integration testing.
